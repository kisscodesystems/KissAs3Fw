# KissAs3Fw

Actionscript3 framework, based on and built with the fully supported Harman AirSDK (previously Adobe AirSDK).

We would like to introduce our Actionscript3 based framework that is usable to build applications onto multiple platforms using Air technology of Harman.

This framework will contain the set of frequently used UI components implemented based on our ideas and will grow continuously.
