Actionscript3 based framework for Flash Player or Air of Adobe.

 We would like to introduce our Actionscript3 based framework that is usable to build applications onto multiple platforms using Air or Flash Player of Adobe.

This framework will contain the set of frequently used UI components implemented based on our ideas and will grow continuously.

This is not like flex: does not use mxml documents - apps have to be programmed, even the displaying of the user interface.
But it will be simple and the developer wins the almost perfect control over its objects (as expectable)!
Demo applications will be programmed to demonstrate how easy the usage of the framework is.
